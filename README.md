salebot: anti-vandalism bot for Wikipedia

Salebot follows recent changes on IRC, detects the most obvious cases of vandalism, and attempts to revert them.
It tries to sort out editors between likely vandals and good-faith editors, using a scoring system. Trusted
users are no longer watched, so Salebot concentrates on new editors.

Salebot runs on the French and Portuguese Wikipedias.
