**THIS FORK IS A WORK IN PROGRESS â€” DON'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED**

**salebot** is an anti-vandalism bot for Wikipedia

Salebot follows recent changes on IRC, detects the most obvious cases of 
vandalism, and attempts to revert them.
It tries to sort out editors between likely vandals and good-faith editors,
using a scoring system. Trusted users are no longer watched, so Salebot
concentrates on new editors.

Salebot runs on the French and Portuguese Wikipedias.
